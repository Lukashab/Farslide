#presentation can contain two types of elements
  #topic - element containing other elements (topic or node or even markup content). Topic is representing second type of direction (INSIDE), that can be done in presentation.
           #From topic you can go BEFORE, AFTER, UP or INSIDE according to specific situation
           #Topic can also contain only markdown content, but in this case, we recommend to use node element instead
  #node - element containing markdown content transformed to html during the generation process.
          #From node you can go BEFORE, AFTER or UP according to specific situation
